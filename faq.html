                <h3>What is adWise?</h3>
                <p>A web application which aims to guide the undergraduate CS majors at
                    LUMS to choose the right courses. By filtering out the courses based on prerequisites
                    and clashes, the application provides each student with a clear choice of courses
                    in each field. adWise also displays courses being offered in the upcoming semester
                    including their schedule and course outline.<br />
                    Not only that, it suggests career options and instructors as advisers according
                    to a particular student’s field of interest. Students can check and post reviews
                    about a particular course or instructor. The idea is to contain all the important and crucial
                    functionality of Suraj, Portal and LDF on a single platform, thus, making the task of choosing
                    a course easier and hassle-free.
